# VoltAGE v0.0.1
VOLunTary Acts of Gifting Endlessly

# Development Notes
This is a react native product for quickly capturing images of items that are intended to be gifted, then making note of whether they were gifted!


# Goal

A mobile application to assist in voluntary acts of gifting, that continue endlessly.

What is gifting endlessly?
An endless gift is a gift that propagates itself.

That is every act of gifting has a non-zero probability of leading to another act of gifting.

VoltAGE is an experimental app to facilitate the onset, continuation and observation of an act of endless gifting.

How does VoltAGE work?

First a definition:  A voluntary gift is something that you intend to offer to someone else, with an explicit understanding that the person to which you offer has the choice to say:

"yes! I would love your gift, thank you for offering!" 

or 

"no! I politely refuse to accept your gift, but thank you for offering!" 

The voluntary nature of the gift is mutual! You voluntarily offer the gift; they voluntarily accept, or politely refuse! Either answer is totally acceptable! 

In fact, every step of VoltAGE is totaly voluntary. Voluntary is the number one value to protect to initiate an act of endless gifting!

1. Create: Start by creating an intentionally voluntary gift. Voluntarily record the initiation of the gift: its creation. Keep it simple. Take a picture of what you created that you intend to voluntairily gift.

2. Offer: When a moment strikes you to gift what you've created, offer it completely voluntarily. Be warm. Never force the issue. You might find that you need to explain the situation. Everyone has been offered something described as a "gift" or "free" that is actually a "strings-attached transaction" and people are rightfully suspicious of free things. I know I am!
 
You might try explaining the situation: "I make these so that I can give them away. Every time I give one away, it means I get the gift of creating a new one! I'm just getting started! It's totally voluntary. You can say no. But you can also say yes!"

If the giftee –the person to whom you are talking– says "no thanks!" say "ok! No worries!"

If the giftee instead says "wow! Really!? Thank you!" then say "wow! Really?! Thank YOU!" Remember that the act of accepting a gift is a gift in itself! The giftee is saying "wow! I like what your creation! My life is busy and full, and I'm willing to accept what you've created into it!" That's pretty special.

3. Relax: At this point, whether the answer was "yes" or "no", your job is done! 

Really?

Yes.

That's all it takes.

You can use VoltAGE to make a note that the gift was accepted and is now in the care of someone else! Just tap the image of the gift.

The end!

# Future Directions

## Motivations and Values
Ultimately, it is difficult to create products that non-transactionally observe the creation of value. Most products claim to be free, but aren't.

The free online services that we're accustomed to –email, messaging and social networks– claim to be free. In fact they are transactions, transacting the free product for the right to show you advertisements or sell the data you create through the service.

Freemium services –products that are free for bounded use– are typically transactions of reputation/image

Open source projects, depending on license, are often more deeply free. Many can be used, copied and repurposed without consequence. For-profit entities often exist around popular open source projects. These entities take the open source product, continue to develop it, and then sell products and services around the product. This is another flavor of free, which is that a free version exists for those willing to invest in using the free version, but an enhanced and supported version exists alongside the free version as well.

Public domain projects, of which I've seen a couple great recent examples, set an increasingly bright line for no-strings attached free products. Interestingly, the level of free-ness of public domain projects appears to me to be as much as in image and reputation, or a statement of the clear and secure developers beliefs.

This project definitely falls under public domain values.

## Goals

Above all, protect voluntary participatory nature. Hard-line. This product is an exploration of truly free, truly voluntary gifting. Can it be started? Can it be propagated? Can it be observed? Can it be maintained? What challenges exist?

Truly Voluntary Propagation: How does a voluntary gift lead to another voluntary gift? How do we know?

Truly Voluntary Participatory Observation: Does observation fundamentally degrade the nature of a voluntary gift? That is, is it impossible to create a system of measurement that is fundamentally non-transactional? Or does generating and collecting data fundamentally create a transaction: 

Explicit examples: 
-Giftee accepts the gift and I generate data
-I give the gift and I generate data
-I give the gift and you generate data
-You give the gift and you generate data

Do these exmaples degrade the integrity of the hard-line value of voluntary participation.

An Endless Physical Product: Many gifts are percieved of as physical and terminal. That is a physical thing –the gift– is given from one person to another. Experiences are increasingly seen as gifts wherein a person creates an experience for the reciever. 

A third form of gift increasingly exists, which is the expectation of having a right to a version of a physical thing. Versions of software improve over time. Unlike physical things, software typically doesn't weather or degrade. It's surrounding environment often advances such that without maintenance the output and performance of the software degrades. But physical things degrade through entropy:
-rechargeable battery chemistry becomes less efficient over time
-non-rechargable batteries spend their finite supply of electrons
-a plant dies
-an adhesive degrades
-a lightbulb burns out
-an electrical circuit becomes damaged from exposure to water
-metal rusts

As any of these events occur, one might like a product that is a perpetual guarantee that the product will persist. Great modern electronics operate on this model: Tesla offers an 8-year "infinite mile" guarantee, Apple sells Apple Care.

A better way of seeing an endless physical product is extending the time-horizon of the relationship with the products user to the duration that the user is willing to participate in the product. That is, the producer promises to be there so long as the user is willing to use the product. This is a good thing. These sorts of offers are often mutually beneficial: they make the product better while adding increasing value to the user who is guaranteed access to the product. Additionally an extended time-horizon relationship can reduce waste by plugging the end-life of the product into the start-life of a new version. If the current version of your product fails, we'll give you a new one, if you give it back to us.

## Technical

A voluntary product cannot be onerous, and it must be truly honest.

Most software is a least a little onerous. It takes time to figure out how to use a new tool. We minimize that by producing a product that creates value in as few actions as possible:
-mobile product (pocket availability)
-operates on actions rather than instructions (symbols and actions)
-use state-of-art algorithms to process input and product output (computer vision for gift classification)

Most software is difficult to make transparent. Access to source code is a start-point, but not an end-point. Even if they can see your source code, most users can't read your source code. Deep trust in software itself is extraordinarily complex, and perhaps an intractable problem. Deep trust in people is the typical solution. The quality of their trust in your software product, is a ballance of the usefulness of your product and the quality of the trust in the humans who created the software. Typically there is no bottom to software; there is always a deeper layer underneath your curreny abstraction. Woof.

Minimal solution is to ellucidate with integrity, the processes by which your software works. This goal can be advanced by  clear insightful blog posts for lay-people on technical subjects.
